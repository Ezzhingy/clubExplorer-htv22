# Clubify-htv22
Hack the Valley 7 2022, Platform for Clubs to Voice their Events

## üí° Inspiration
Catching us off guard with a sudden global attack, the pandemic stripped away our freedom to participate in events and hangouts. UTSC is no exception. For many of us, that meant slaving away in front of screens for the past two years. Eventually, the long awaited in-person events returned once again as the world slowly began to return to normality. However, the lack of all-inclusive platforms has created a struggle for students devoted to club searching. Our goal with Clubify is to unite all opportunities found at UTSC onto one platform and provide students with a memorable navigating experience; the glue that connects all students.  

## üîç What it does
Clubify is a community app dedicated to spreading diversity and inclusivity among UTSC students. After a quick convenience sampling, we found that many UTSC students were unaware of the sheer amount of clubs being offered at their school. Clubify provides club admins with a method of inputting their club information and contact details, which are then displayed, available for all of UTSC to see.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it was built
Clubify was built with the following tools and languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- React
- Flask
- SQLite3

## üöß Challenges we ran into
Most of the front-end development was smooth sailing. However, forming the connection between the front-end and back-end was a hassle. It took the majority of our time to figure out how to collect user input and store it within the database, as well as extract that information to display on the interface. 

## ‚úîÔ∏è Accomplishments that we're proud of
For many of us, it was our first time working in a group environment at a hackathon and we are all proud of what we were able to build in such a short amount of time. Other accomplishments include:
- Learning how to form the connection between front-end and back-end
- Figuring out how to use databases and queries
- Working together collaboratively as a team, despite not knowing each other prior to the event

## üìö What we learned
Through the implementation of Clubify, we learned many new concepts such as, but not limited to: how to connect React from frontend to Flask in the backend; how to use SQLite3 to build a database; and version control amongst the team members. The biggest takeaway from this event is the importance of collaboration and help among peers to put together a shared vision.

## üî≠ What's next for Clubify
At Clubify, we are always aiming to maximize our potential in our user interface and features, while not sacrificing the performance and purpose to deliver an efficient yet immersive experience. We have potential features to expand on in the future, such as adding a searching bar, filter list, and adding upcoming events to the clubs. We also have plans to expand usability to students at other universities and communities.
